The basic concept is that everyone has a box.
üì¶
The box contains certain amount of fucks. 
The number of fucks in the box differs from person to person.
Some have more, some have less.

What's important is that every time you perform a task you use some fucks. If it is an irritating task you use more fucks and if it is a task that you love, you would use lesser fucks.
‚è≥
Now, another thing to keep in mind is that the number of fucks will reduce as the day goes by. So by evening you might end up with lesser fucks than when you started the day.
The only way to replenish fucks is to sleep and wake up in the morning or do something that inspires you. In essence, its difficult to replenish. 

The theory states that you have a limited amount of fucks. It's upto you who or what you spend it on.
Hence, be mindful and DON'T GIVE A FUCK !!
